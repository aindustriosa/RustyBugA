# Line follower competition rules.

In a nutshell, the competition consists in making the robots follow a closed path. The robot that finishes a number of laps in the shorter time wins.

There are a number of variants of extra rules that fixes how the tournament develops and limits the circuit and robot characteristics. Let's see some of them.

## Open-robotsports' "Normativa para velocistas"

Open-robotsports has written a series of [rules for line followers](https://github.com/open-robosports/normativa-velocistas/tree/master) that contains their experience in many competitions in Spain. The summary of these rules are:

- The robots: Must weigh less than 2 Kg and be less than 30 cm long, 20 cm wide and 13 cm high. The robot must be autonomous.
- The circuit: It is a white PVC canvas with one or two black lines that define the tracks the robots must follow. The lines are 20±2 mm thick and the curves have a minimal radius of 40±2 cm.
- Competition development: There is a first phase there the judges validate the robots. In a second phase, there is classification round were the robots individually have 2 tries to complete 1 round to the circuit, qualifying the fastest ones. In a third phase is a play off between pair of classified robots. The robots start at the same time in opposite parts of the circuit and the first who reaches the opponent wins (best of three takes)

## OSHWDem rules

The [Open Software and Hardware Demonstration at A Coruña](https://oshwdem.org/) celebrates a line follower competition every year. The rules are pretty similar to the "Normativa para velocistas", having two flavours. The ["persecución"](http://rules.oshwdem.org/persecucion_velocistas_es) mode is the same as the "Normativa". The ["velocistas"](http://rules.oshwdem.org/velocistas_es) mode only has the classification round, winning the fastest individual lap.

## Other variants

### Liga española de robótica

You can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ligaderobots) some old videos from the Spanish robotics league. The used robots the same size as Rusty's and in the different years proposed some innovative rules regarding the circuit and the competition rules.

### Japan competitions

Here goes a number of examples of Japanese competitions with videos:
